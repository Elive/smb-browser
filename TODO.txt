 * if the dir of the mount location (/home/$USER/mnt) not exist, create it

 * in mount options, the "ro" and "rw" words are not intuitive for end-users that may not know it, change it to something like "ro: read only mode" and "rw: read and write mode"

 * I read in the "help" that there's a checkbox about "scan" features, instead of that, what about a simple button in the Main tab called "scan the entire network" or something like that ?

 * tooltips everywhere that may be needed (preferences tab basically)

 * browse button should call hte mount first, if the mountpoint is already not mounted
 
 * automatic scanning startup when the first tab is reached :)  (may we need a Stop button there too)

 * when i click in "workgroup" i see my other computers but i see the mine too, what do you think about remove the "own" computer from the list ?
