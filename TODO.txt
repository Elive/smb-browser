 * tooltips everywhere that may be needed (preferences tab basically)

 * browse button should call hte mount first, if the mountpoint is already not mounted
	this dosent make sense. How will it know what to mount
 
 * automatic scanning startup when the first tab is reached :)  (may we need a Stop button there too)

 * when i click in "workgroup" i see my other computers but i see the mine too, what do you think about remove the "own" computer from the list ?
